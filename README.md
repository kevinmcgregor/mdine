# mdine
**M**icrobiome **Di**fferential **N**etwork **E**stimation (**mdine**) allows the estimation of OTU co-occurrence networks within two separate groups, where the networks are defined through precision matrices.  The difference between the two precision matrices is also estimated, along with corresponding interval estimates.  This work was developed in the [Greenwood Lab](https://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/) at McGill University.

## Installation
The first step to installing **mdine** is to install [rstan](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) along with the appropriate compiler.  The steps on how to do this are different based on your OS:

### Installing **mdine** for Mac/Linux
* Install **rstan** by going to the [installation page](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) and following the Mac/Linux instructions.
  * Make sure you have a C++ toolchain and configuration installed as described in the instructions.

Once **rstan** has been successfully installed, run the following code to install **mdine**:
* Run the following code in R:
```r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}
install_github("kevinmcgregor/mdine", dependencies=TRUE)
```


### Installing **mdine** Windows
* Install **rstan** by going to the [installation page](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) and following the Windows instructions.
  * Make sure to install **rtools** as described in the instructions.

Once **rstan** has been successfully installed, run the following code to install **mdine**:
* Run the following code in R:
```r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}
install_github("kevinmcgregor/mdine", dependencies=TRUE)
```
